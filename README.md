# Cat and Dog Image Classification using CNN

This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model built to classify images of cats and dogs. The model uses TensorFlow and Keras libraries, achieving high accuracy in binary classification.

## Project Overview
This project implements a CNN in Python using Keras and TensorFlow, designed to classify images as either cats or dogs. The CNN learns distinctive features through convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

## Model Architecture
- **Input Shape**: 128x128 RGB images
- **Layers**:
  - Multiple Convolutional Layers with Max Pooling
  - Dropout Layers to reduce overfitting
  - Dense Layers for final classification

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow and Keras libraries
- Dataset of cat and dog images

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
